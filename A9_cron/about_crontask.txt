1. How to Set Up and Test the Daily File Cleanup Task
Steps to Set Up
Open the crontab for editing:
crontab -e
Add the following entry to delete all files in the ~/test directory daily at 2:00 AM:
0 2 * * * rm -rf ~/test/*
Save and exit the crontab editor.
Steps to Test
Temporarily change the schedule to run the cleanup job every minute for testing:

* * * * * rm -rf ~/test/*
Create some test files in the directory:

touch ~/test/test_file1.txt ~/test/test_file2.txt
Wait for one minute, then check the directory:

ls ~/test
If the job works correctly, the directory should be empty.

Once tested, restore the original schedule by editing the crontab:

0 2 * * * rm -rf ~/test/*
2. How to Schedule a Weekly Backup and Verify It Works
Steps to Set Up
Open the crontab for editing:
crontab -e
Add the following entry to create a backup of the ~/test directory every Sunday at 3:00 AM:
0 3 * * 0 tar -czf ~/test_backup_$(date +\%F).tar.gz ~/test/
The $(date +\%F) generates the current date (e.g., 2024-11-17) for the backup filename.
Save and exit the crontab editor.
Steps to Verify
Test the job manually by running the command directly in the terminal:
tar -czf ~/test_backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz ~/test/
Check the ~ directory for the backup file:
ls ~ | grep "test_backup"
If successful, restore the crontab and let the job run on schedule.
